It has several advantages in comparison with Zustand - it is framework-agnostic, store and reducers are defined separately what is better for readability, and it generates an object instead of hook so it can be used outside of React component if needed (react hooks are also provided so can decide whether to use or not). Desirable provides react hooks to use state in a component so you can use your state wherever you need. On the other hand, it has all the benefits of Zustand like multistores, simple logic of store updating and so on. Also, Desirable has awesome api to subscribe on specific slices of the store to prevent performance problems.",
